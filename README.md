## About Quizzer

#### Quizzer is an open source quiz application with an editor that can be used in the class or in any sort of competition context.
I made the first few prototypes of Quizzer for my scout group's annual history contest. After a while, I got annoyed of building these quick and dirty apps and wanted to create something that can be easily recycled as well as used by others. Feel free to do so!

*Quizzer currently supports two languages: English and Hungarian.*

## Instructions

#### 1. Download the .jar files of the latest version from the [Releases view](https://github.com/hszilard93/Quizzer/releases) and proceed to instruction 2a. If you do not have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed (minimum version 1.8), and you are using a Windows operating system, you might want to download the .zip files. Note, however, that the .zip files are *significantly* larger in size. After this, proceed to instruction 2b.
#### 2a. The .jar files should be able to run on any desktop operating system, but you need to have the Java Runtime Environment installed (minimum version 1.8) first (just Google 'JRE', if you don't already have it!).
#### 2b. Unpack the .zip files using a packaging tool (for example WinRAR or 7-Zip). After this, you can simply run the .exe files from the resulting directories.
